<p><a href="../../classes/Ractor.html"><code>Ractor</code></a> is a Actor-model abstraction for Ruby that provides thread-safe parallel execution.</p>

<p><a href="../../classes/Ractor.html#method-c-new"><code>Ractor.new</code></a> can make a new <a href="../../classes/Ractor.html"><code>Ractor</code></a>, and it will run in parallel.</p>

<pre><code># The simplest ractor
r = Ractor.new {puts &quot;I am in Ractor!&quot;}
r.take # wait for it to finish
# here &quot;I am in Ractor!&quot; would be printed
</code></pre>

<p>Ractors do not share usual objects, so the same kinds of thread-safety concerns such as data-race, race-conditions are not available on multi-ractor programming.</p>

<p>To achieve this, ractors severely limit object sharing between different ractors. For example, unlike threads, ractors can’t access each other’s objects, nor any objects through variables of the outer scope.</p>

<pre><code>a = 1
r = Ractor.new {puts &quot;I am in Ractor! a=#{a}&quot;}
# fails immediately with
# ArgumentError (can not isolate a Proc because it accesses outer variables (a).)
</code></pre>

<p>On CRuby (the default implementation), Global Virtual Machine Lock (GVL) is held per ractor, so ractors are performed in parallel without locking each other.</p>

<p>Instead of accessing the shared state, the objects should be passed to and from ractors via sending and receiving objects as messages.</p>

<pre><code>a = 1
r = Ractor.new do
  a_in_ractor = receive # receive blocks till somebody will pass message
  puts &quot;I am in Ractor! a=#{a_in_ractor}&quot;
end
r.send(a)  # pass it
r.take
# here &quot;I am in Ractor! a=1&quot; would be printed
</code></pre>

<p>There are two pairs of methods for sending/receiving messages:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><a href="../../classes/Ractor.html#method-i-send"><code>Ractor#send</code></a> and <a href="../../classes/Ractor.html#method-c-receive"><code>Ractor.receive</code></a> for when the <em>sender</em> knows the receiver (push);</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="../../classes/Ractor.html#method-c-yield"><code>Ractor.yield</code></a> and <a href="../../classes/Ractor.html#method-i-take"><code>Ractor#take</code></a> for when the <em>receiver</em> knows the sender (pull);</p>
</li></ul>

<p>In addition to that, an argument to <a href="../../classes/Ractor.html#method-c-new"><code>Ractor.new</code></a> would be passed to block and available there as if received by <a href="../../classes/Ractor.html#method-c-receive"><code>Ractor.receive</code></a>, and the last block value would be sent outside of the ractor as if sent by <a href="../../classes/Ractor.html#method-c-yield"><code>Ractor.yield</code></a>.</p>

<p>A little demonstration on a classic ping-pong:</p>

<pre><code>server = Ractor.new do
  puts &quot;Server starts: #{self.inspect}&quot;
  puts &quot;Server sends: ping&quot;
  Ractor.yield &#39;ping&#39;                       # The server doesn&#39;t know the receiver and sends to whoever interested
  received = Ractor.receive                 # The server doesn&#39;t know the sender and receives from whoever sent
  puts &quot;Server received: #{received}&quot;
end

client = Ractor.new(server) do |srv|        # The server is sent inside client, and available as srv
  puts &quot;Client starts: #{self.inspect}&quot;
  received = srv.take                       # The Client takes a message specifically from the server
  puts &quot;Client received from &quot; \
       &quot;#{srv.inspect}: #{received}&quot;
  puts &quot;Client sends to &quot; \
       &quot;#{srv.inspect}: pong&quot;
  srv.send &#39;pong&#39;                           # The client sends a message specifically to the server
end

[client, server].each(&amp;:take)               # Wait till they both finish
</code></pre>

<p>This will output:</p>

<pre><code>Server starts: #&lt;Ractor:#2 test.rb:1 running&gt;
Server sends: ping
Client starts: #&lt;Ractor:#3 test.rb:8 running&gt;
Client received from #&lt;Ractor:#2 rac.rb:1 blocking&gt;: ping
Client sends to #&lt;Ractor:#2 rac.rb:1 blocking&gt;: pong
Server received: pong
</code></pre>

<p>It is said that <a href="../../classes/Ractor.html"><code>Ractor</code></a> receives messages via the <em>incoming port</em>, and sends them to the <em>outgoing port</em>. Either one can be disabled with <a href="../../classes/Ractor.html#method-i-close_incoming"><code>Ractor#close_incoming</code></a> and <a href="../../classes/Ractor.html#method-i-close_outgoing"><code>Ractor#close_outgoing</code></a> respectively. If a ractor terminated, its ports will be closed automatically.</p>

<h2 id="label-Shareable+and+unshareable+objects">Shareable and unshareable objects</h2>

<p>When the object is sent to and from the ractor, it is important to understand whether the object is shareable or unshareable. Most of objects are unshareable objects.</p>

<p>Shareable objects are basically those which can be used by several threads without compromising thread-safety; e.g. immutable ones. <a href="../../classes/Ractor.html#method-c-shareable-3F"><code>Ractor.shareable?</code></a> allows to check this, and <a href="../../classes/Ractor.html#method-c-make_shareable"><code>Ractor.make_shareable</code></a> tries to make object shareable if it is not.</p>

<pre><code>Ractor.shareable?(1)            #=&gt; true -- numbers and other immutable basic values are
Ractor.shareable?(&#39;foo&#39;)        #=&gt; false, unless the string is frozen due to # freeze_string_literals: true
Ractor.shareable?(&#39;foo&#39;.freeze) #=&gt; true

ary = [&#39;hello&#39;, &#39;world&#39;]
ary.frozen?                 #=&gt; false
ary[0].frozen?              #=&gt; false
Ractor.make_shareable(ary)
ary.frozen?                 #=&gt; true
ary[0].frozen?              #=&gt; true
ary[1].frozen?              #=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>When a shareable object is sent (via send or <a href="../../classes/Ractor.html#method-c-yield"><code>Ractor.yield</code></a>), no additional processing happens, and it just becomes usable by both ractors. When an unshareable object is sent, it can be either <em>copied</em> or <em>moved</em>. The first is the default, and it makes the object’s full copy by deep cloning of non-shareable parts of its structure.</p>

<pre><code>data = [&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;.freeze]
r = Ractor.new do
  data2 = Ractor.receive
  puts &quot;In ractor: #{data2.object_id}, #{data2[0].object_id}, #{data2[1].object_id}&quot;
end
r.send(data)
r.take
puts &quot;Outside  : #{data.object_id}, #{data[0].object_id}, #{data[1].object_id}&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This will output:</p>

<pre><code>In ractor: 340, 360, 320
Outside  : 380, 400, 320
</code></pre>

<p>(Note that object id of both array and non-frozen string inside array have changed inside the ractor, showing it is different objects. But the second array’s element, which is a shareable frozen string, has the same object_id.)</p>

<p>Deep cloning of the objects may be slow, and sometimes impossible. Alternatively, <code>move: true</code> may be used on sending. This will <em>move</em> the object to the receiving ractor, making it inaccessible for a sending ractor.</p>

<pre><code>data = [&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;]
r = Ractor.new do
  data_in_ractor = Ractor.receive
  puts &quot;In ractor: #{data_in_ractor.object_id}, #{data_in_ractor[0].object_id}&quot;
end
r.send(data, move: true)
r.take
puts &quot;Outside: moved? #{Ractor::MovedObject === data}&quot;
puts &quot;Outside: #{data.inspect}&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This will output:</p>

<pre><code>In ractor: 100, 120
Outside: moved? true
test.rb:9:in `method_missing&#39;: can not send any methods to a moved object (Ractor::MovedError)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that even <code>inspect</code> (and more basic methods like <code>__id__</code>) is inaccessible on a moved object.</p>

<p>Besides frozen objects, there are shareable objects. <a href="../../classes/Class.html"><code>Class</code></a> and <a href="../../classes/Module.html"><code>Module</code></a> objects are shareable so the Class/Module definitions are shared between ractors. <a href="../../classes/Ractor.html"><code>Ractor</code></a> objects are also shareable objects. All operations for the shareable mutable objects are thread-safe, so the thread-safety property will be kept. We can not define mutable shareable objects in Ruby, but C extensions can introduce them.</p>

<p>It is prohibited to access instance variables of mutable shareable objects (especially Modules and classes) from ractors other than main:</p>

<pre><code>class C
  class &lt;&lt; self
    attr_accessor :tricky
  end
end

C.tricky = &#39;test&#39;

r = Ractor.new(C) do |cls|
  puts &quot;I see #{cls}&quot;
  puts &quot;I can&#39;t see #{cls.tricky}&quot;
end
r.take
# I see C
# can not access instance variables of classes/modules from non-main Ractors (RuntimeError)
</code></pre>

<p>Ractors can access constants if they are shareable. The main <a href="../../classes/Ractor.html"><code>Ractor</code></a> is the only one that can access non-shareable constants.</p>

<pre><code>GOOD = &#39;good&#39;.freeze
BAD = &#39;bad&#39;

r = Ractor.new do
  puts &quot;GOOD=#{GOOD}&quot;
  puts &quot;BAD=#{BAD}&quot;
end
r.take
# GOOD=good
# can not access non-shareable objects in constant Object::BAD by non-main Ractor. (NameError)

# Consider the same C class from above

r = Ractor.new do
  puts &quot;I see #{C}&quot;
  puts &quot;I can&#39;t see #{C.tricky}&quot;
end
r.take
# I see C
# can not access instance variables of classes/modules from non-main Ractors (RuntimeError)
</code></pre>

<p>See also the description of <code># shareable_constant_value</code> pragma in Comments syntax explanation.</p>

<h2 id="label-Ractors+vs+threads">Ractors vs threads</h2>

<p>Each ractor creates its own thread. New threads can be created from inside ractor (and, on CRuby, sharing GVL with other threads of this ractor).</p>

<pre><code>r = Ractor.new do
  a = 1
  Thread.new {puts &quot;Thread in ractor: a=#{a}&quot;}.join
end
r.take
# Here &quot;Thread in ractor: a=1&quot; will be printed
</code></pre>

<h2 id="label-Note+on+code+examples">Note on code examples</h2>

<p>In examples below, sometimes we use the following method to wait till ractors that are not currently blocked will finish (or process till next blocking) method.</p>

<pre><code>def wait
  sleep(0.1)
end
</code></pre>

<p>It is **only for demonstration purposes** and shouldn’t be used in a real code. Most of the times, just take is used to wait till ractor will finish.</p>
